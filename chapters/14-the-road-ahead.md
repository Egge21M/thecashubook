## Implementation notes (chapter-level)
- Inputs: current architecture + product roadmap
- Outputs: forward-compatible strategy and contribution plan
- State transitions: prototype -> product -> platform
- Failure boundaries: avoid premature commitments to unstable assumptions

## Minimal flow (pseudocode)
```text
roadmap = plan_next_90_days(current_state, ecosystem_signals)
execute(roadmap)
review_monthly_and_adjust()
```

## Common failure modes
1. Betting on speculative features too early
   - Symptom: rewrite churn and delivery delays
   - Root cause: weak prioritization discipline
   - Mitigation: stage-gated adoption policy

## Checklist
- [ ] 90-day action plan documented
- [ ] Strategy assumptions explicitly listed
- [ ] Monthly review cadence defined

## Open questions
- Which strategic bets belong in v1 vs v2 of your product?
