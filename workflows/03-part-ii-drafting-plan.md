## Sequence

2. Ch5 Mint API Deep Dive
3. Ch6 Wallet Architecture
4. Ch7 Lightning Integration
5. Ch8 Security Engineering
6. Ch9 Privacy Engineering
7. Ch10 Interoperability & Standards

## Per-Chapter Execution
- Day 1: Sections .1–.4
- Day 2: Sections .5–.8
- Day 3: Sections .9–.12 + checklist + code sketch
- Day 4: edit pass, tighten examples, cross-links

## Quality Gates
- No hand-wavy claims without implementation context.
- Every chapter must include at least one failure mode table.
- Every chapter must include at least one test strategy note.
- Keep language practical: builder-focused, no fluff.

## Output Targets
- 1 draft-complete chapter every 4 days.
- Part II first complete draft in ~4 weeks.
