# Cashu Ecash Book — Session Notes (2026-02-19)

## Goal
Write a developer-focused book about Cashu ecash, covering use cases with strong emphasis on practical implementation.

## Agreed Direction
- Positioning: **developer-first field guide** (not a theory-heavy book)
- Audience:
  - Bitcoin devs with Lightning basics
  - Backend/full-stack engineers exploring Cashu integrations
  - Builders of wallets, bots, marketplaces, APIs

## Working Title
**Building with Cashu: Practical Ecash for Bitcoin Developers**

## Proposed Book Architecture
### Part I — Why Cashu exists
1. The Problem Space
2. What Cashu Is (and Is Not)
3. Core Mental Model

### Part II — Building blocks (developer core)
4. Protocol Primitives
5. Mint API Deep Dive
6. Wallet Architecture
7. Lightning Integration
8. Security Engineering
9. Privacy Engineering
10. Interoperability & Standards

### Part III — Real products and patterns
11. Use Cases That Actually Work
12. Design Patterns
13. Production Playbook
14. The Road Ahead

## Suggested Per-Chapter Template
- Why this matters
- Concept
- Implementation notes
- Common failure modes
- Minimal code example
- Checklist

## Companion Repo Recommendation
- `/examples/` runnable snippets
- `/reference/` protocol diagrams and flows
- `/recipes/` focused mini-builds
- `/chapters/` source markdown

## Suggested 90-Day Plan
- Weeks 1–2: outline + chapter briefs + glossary
- Weeks 3–6: draft Part II first
- Weeks 7–8: draft Part III
- Weeks 9–10: draft Part I + intro/conclusion
- Weeks 11–12: technical review + edits
